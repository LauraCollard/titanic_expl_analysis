# Exploratory data analysis: Titanic dataset


The sinking of the RMS Titanic is probably the best known shipwreck in history. On the night of 14 April 1912, the "unsinkable ship" hit an iceberg in the North Atlantic Ocean and sank, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. The dataset is widely available. In particular, it is used as a beginner's guide to [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) competitions to get experience in machine learning.

In this notebook, we will explore the famous dataset by trying to answer the following questions:

- Who were the passengers?
- Which socio-economic class did they belong to?
- Where were the passengers from?
- What factors helped passengers survive the shipwreck?



**Toolkit**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
